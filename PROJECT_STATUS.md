# KhawarizMind Project Status

## Brief Description
KhawarizMind is a multi-service intelligent document management platform. The solution couples a .NET 8 microservice backend with a React (Node.js 20) frontend to deliver document ingestion, workflow automation, tenant management, and AI-assisted capabilities backed by a shared SQLite persistence layer.

## Status Legend
- ✅ **Stable** – Feature is implemented and in regular use.
- 🚧 **In Progress** – Active development with partial functionality available.
- 🧱 **Scaffolded** – Project skeleton or boilerplate exists, but feature work has not started.
- 📝 **Planned** – Placeholder for upcoming work with no implementation yet.

## Solution Root

## Backend (`KhawarizMind-backend`)
| Component | Summary | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Common/` | Shared domain models, authentication helpers, audit logging, AI abstractions, and workflow primitives. | 🚧 | Richly populated; continues to evolve alongside services. |
| `Infrastructure/` | Centralized persistence configuration and infrastructure concerns. | 🚧 | Houses EF Core setup and database helpers. |
| `AIService/` | Service host for AI-driven features. | 🧱 | Currently scaffolded with configuration and host boilerplate only. |
| `AuthService/` | Authentication API with controllers and models for managing users/tokens. | 🚧 | Core flows implemented; expect ongoing refinement. |
| `DocumentService/` | Document ingestion, metadata, storage, and controller logic. | 🚧 | Largest service; multiple submodules actively developed. |
| `FormService/` | Form-centric workflows. | 🧱 | Service shell present without feature logic. |
| `ImageProcessingService/` | Image manipulation and OCR processing. | 🧱 | Awaiting concrete implementations. |
| `IntegrationService/` | External system integration host leveraging shared secrets configuration. | 🧱 | Configuration-ready; integration adapters pending. |
| `ScanningService/` | Hardware/software scanning orchestration service. | 🧱 | Placeholder awaiting development. |
| `TenantManagementService/` | Tenant lifecycle management with authentication, authorization, services, and controllers. | 🚧 | Includes test project (`TenantManagementService.Tests`). |
| `TenantManagementService.Tests/` | Unit tests for tenant controllers. | 🚧 | Test scaffolding exists; expand coverage as features mature. |
| `ViewerService/` | Document viewing gateway. | 🧱 | Needs implementation for rendering/streaming. |
| `WorkflowService/` | Workflow orchestration endpoints. | 🧱 | Bootstrapped host awaiting workflow logic. |

## Frontend (`KhawarizMind-frontend`)
| Component | Summary | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `public/` | Static assets, HTML template, and manifest configuration. | 🚧 | Ready for branding/content updates. |
| `scripts/` | Helper scripts (e.g., lint, build automation). | 🚧 | Customize as tooling evolves. |
| `src/App.js` & `App.css` | Application shell wiring routing and global styles. | 🚧 | Baseline UI present; expand as features land. |
| `src/components/` | Reusable UI components library. | 🚧 | Contains building blocks for modules. |
| `src/context/` | React context providers for shared state. | 🚧 | Manage auth, theming, and settings. |
| `src/modules/` | Feature modules aligned with backend domains. | 🚧 | Use for domain-specific UI flows. |
| `src/pages/` | Top-level routed pages. | 🚧 | Extend for new user journeys. |
| `src/services/` | API clients and integration utilities. | 🚧 | Expand alongside backend endpoints. |
| `src/utils/` | Helpers, formatters, and shared utilities. | 🚧 | Continue to generalize common logic. |
| `src/theme.js` | Theming constants and MUI configuration. | 🚧 | Adjust as design system matures. |
| `package.json` | Frontend dependencies and npm scripts. | ✅ | Aligns with Node.js 20 & npm 10 toolchain. |

## Maintenance Notes
- Update this document whenever service responsibilities or statuses change.
- Use consistent status icons from the legend to keep historical tracking clear.
- Coordinate updates with both backend and frontend owners to maintain a synchronized roadmap.
